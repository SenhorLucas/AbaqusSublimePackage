# Abaqus Sublime Package
Tool set for faster Abaqus keywords editing with Sublime Text 3

This is a fork of the original work by [SenhorLucas](https://github.com/SenhorLucas/AbaqusSublimePackage). The following changes have been made:
1. Added a Comment metadata file so that the standard keyboard shortcuts for line comments (Ctl+/) and block comments (Ctl+Shft+/) can be used to automatically comment/uncomment selected lines.

## Plugins
### Remove Undesired Empty Comments
Sometimes comments are just on the way, especially those created by some pre-processors:

## Installation guide
------------------
 **With Package Control**

The easiest way to install is through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation)

Once you install Package Control, restart Sublime Text, bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", then select [Abaqus](https://github.com/SenhorLucas/AbaqusSublimePackage). This method will automatically keep Abaqus Sublime Package up to date.

 **Manual Installation**

1. Download "AbaqusSublimePackage" folder
2. Go to your packages (in Sublime : Preferences > Browse Packages...)
3. Copy the folder "AbaqusSublimePackage" in this folder
